In this project,
   Gradle:3.2.0-beta05
   Kotlin: 1.2.51 versions are used.
This project was implemented by using Android Studio 3.2 Preview Version.

MVVM&MVP Patterns are used. 
Instead of using ViewModel of Android, BehavioralRelay Library is used.
Instead of using Android Navigation Component, I handle Navigation by myself. Because Android Navigation component is not unit testable.
Android Data Binding is used.
Only Portrait Mode is supported. If needed I can implement Landscape version also.
